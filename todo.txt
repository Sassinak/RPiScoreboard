TODO:

- include pause button? stop acts as pause

- develop "re-set values" pop-up box if all goes wrong (limited ressources
	prevent me from using netbeans to do this, unsure how without it) 
	Considering simple popup instead of loading jquery...
	
- IF Arduino can data stream, develop the PWN signal output. 
	- webiopi no fine tuning for period time, only ratio
	- import RPIO.py ?
	- git branch ?
